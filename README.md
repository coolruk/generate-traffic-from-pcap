# generate-traffic-from-pcap

Nowadays, a lot of applications collect network traffic and save it to PCAP file so that we can analyse them to find out suspicious activity and error. However, it is very difficult to reproduce traffic from pcap file to replay the traffic again. So I used pcap.net library to generate actual traffic and utilised this to make network attack tools.

-Prerequisite: 
Npcap 0.992, Wireshark(C:\Program Files\WIRESHARK if you want to re-order the pcap file.)
